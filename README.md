## Difference Pytest and Pytest-cov

pytest is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. It provides various features and plugins to enhance the testing experience, such as fixtures, parameterized testing, and plugins for code coverage analysis.

pytest-cov, on the other hand, is a plugin for pytest specifically designed to integrate code coverage analysis into your test suite. It generates reports showing which parts of your codebase are covered by your tests and which parts are not. This can be extremely useful for identifying areas of your code that may need additional testing or refactoring to improve test coverage.
